# SHARED_RUNTIME is the toolchain runtime the shared build links against.
#
# Windows takes it statically. The DLL is opened by an emulator at run time -
# QEMU through LoadLibrary, Renode through LoadLibraryW behind a P/Invoke - on a
# machine that has never had a toolchain on it. Linked the default way it
# imports libstdc++-6.dll, which exists inside MSYS2 and almost nowhere else, so
# the build and its tests pass on the runner and the library cannot be opened
# on the target:
#
#   qemu-system-xtensa.exe: sx1262: cannot load the chip model at
#   ...\libvirtualsx1262.dll: The specified module could not be found.
#
# That message names this DLL rather than the dependency it could not find,
# which is why it reads as a missing library rather than a missing runtime.
#
# Shipping the runtime beside this file does not fix it: Windows resolves a
# dynamically loaded DLL's own imports from the loading *process's* directory,
# not from the directory of the DLL being loaded, so a copy would have to sit
# next to every host that opens us. Static is the only version that travels.
# -static rather than -static-libstdc++, because libstdc++ brings
# libwinpthread-1.dll in behind it and the pair have to go together.
#
# Linux and macOS keep the dynamic link. libstdc++ is part of the base system
# on both, and a plugin carrying its own copy into a host process that already
# has one is the worse bet.
