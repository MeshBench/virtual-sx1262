/* virtual-sx1262 - whether the receiver was listening for a frame.
 *
 * The part locks onto a frame during its preamble and then has to stay in
 * receive until the frame ends. A receiver that was in standby, in CAD or
 * transmitting while the preamble went by never locked, and one that left
 * receive after locking lost the frame there: SetStandby aborts a reception
 * rather than pausing it, and SetRx afterwards searches for a new preamble.
 *
 * Off by default. The emulated hosts advance this chip's clock at their own
 * rate, so a frame's start as this clock sees it is only approximately where
 * the engine put it, and those hosts keep the inbox grace instead. A host
 * whose clock is the engine's own switches this on.
