/* The rest of the command set: the commands MeshCore never issues.
 *
 * Its own file because the reason all of these were missing is the same, and it
 * is not a good reason: the model grew to the shape of one firmware's driver,
 * so a command nothing in that path sends was a command that silently did
 * nothing. A host would issue it, get a status byte back, and carry on with the
 * chip in a state it had not asked for.
 *
 * Three kinds of thing live here, and each one says which it is:
 *
 *   ACTED ON    the command changes what the model does.
 *   RECORDED    the command's parameters are stored and reported, and nothing
 *               here acts on them, because acting would mean inventing physics
 *               this model is not given. Recording is still the point: the
 *               fault worth catching is a firmware configured differently from
 *               how its operator believes, and a value nobody can read back is
 *               a value nobody can check.
 *   PLACEHOLDER the command is decoded but its effect is not modelled, and the
 *               comment says what would have to exist first.
 *
 * Nothing here is a stub that pretends. A command that is RECORDED does not
 * report success at something it did not do.
