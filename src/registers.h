/* The SX1262's own tables, transcribed.
 *
 * Separate from both the radio behaviour and the wire protocol because it is
 * neither: it is the datasheet, and the two implementation files below each
 * need about half of it. Kept complete rather than trimmed to what is used
 * today, because a register map with holes in it is harder to check against
 * the part than a full one, and the next opcode this model learns is already
 * named here. That is what [[maybe_unused]] says: these are documentation as
 * much as code, so an unused one is not dead code to be deleted.
 *
 * Source: Semtech SX1261/2 datasheet rev 2.1, tables 11-1 (opcodes) and 13-29
 * (IRQ flags).
