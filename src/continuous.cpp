/* virtual-sx1262 - where received frames land in the data buffer.
 *
 * Each frame goes straight after the last, so a firmware that reads late finds
 * the next one behind it, or over it once 256 bytes have arrived since. A
 * frame the host announces as its carrier begins also lands as it arrives: its
 * length from its header, its payload as its symbols do. A driver that trusts
 * the length it reads after the next header has been received gets the next
 * frame's, which is what the corruption seen on air looks like. See continuous.h
 * for what is modelled rather than documented.
