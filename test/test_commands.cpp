/* The rest of the command set.
 *
 * Every case here was previously an opcode that fell through to "acknowledged
 * and ignored": the firmware issued it, got a status byte, and carried on with
 * the chip in a state it had not asked for.
 *
 * Several of these commands are recorded rather than acted on, and the cases
 * say so. A test that a value can be read back is not a weaker test than one
 * that it changed behaviour: the fault this model exists to catch is a node
 * configured differently from how its operator believes, and a value nobody can
 * read back is a value nobody can check.
